            <p> King Acrisius of Argos wanted a male heir to his throne, 
                so he consulted an Oracle to see of his future. The Oracle
                told him he would receive an heir through his daughter, Danae.
                However, this child would eventually be the cause of his demise.
                To prevent this, Acrisius imprisoned Danae, but Zeus found her,
                they had a son, Perseus. In light of this, Acrisius locked them into
                a chest and casted them into the seas. A fisheman found them and took
                them to the island Seriphos. Seriphos was ruled by King Polydectes
                who took a liking to Danae and wanted to marry her but wanted nothing to
                do with Perseus. To resolve this, King Polydectes tricked Perseus to
                retrieve the head of Gorgon Medusa, a monster whose eyes turned anyone who
                looked at her into stone. Many tried to prove their valor by slaying Medusa
                but all failed.

                Persues embarked on this impossible challenge. With the helps
                of the gods, he received three magical gifts. From Athena, goddess of wisdom,
                a reflective shield; from Hermes, god of travel, winged sands; and from Hades,
                the helm of darkness. Perseus visits the Gaeae sisters to find Medusa's location. 
                He takes their single eye in order to trade for the location. Once given the location,
                he heads to Medusa. At arrival, he uses Athena's shield to see Medusa without
                turning into stone, sneaks up on her and beheads her.
                On his way home, Perseus comes across a lady named Adromeda, who is chained to a rock
                in sacrifice to a sea monster. Perseus kills the monster, saves and marries Andromeda.
                Perseus returns to Seriphos, uses Medusa's head to turn Polydectes and his court to stone
                and bring order to Seriphos.
